## Changes Made for OpenAI Assistant in Production

We've made the following important changes to ensure the Gabriel AI assistant works correctly in production:

1. Fixed the OpenAI fallback check function to prioritize the Assistant API in production
2. Added and verified FORCE_OPENAI_ASSISTANT=true in .env.production
3. Created test scripts to verify the Assistant works in production mode
4. Added deployment scripts to ensure these fixes are applied

## Summary of Changes

### Before
- In production, the app defaulted to fallback mode unless explicitly configured
- This caused the OpenAI Assistant API to not be used in production deployments

### After
- In production, the app now defaults to using the OpenAI Assistant API
- FORCE_OPENAI_ASSISTANT=true is set in the production environment
- Test scripts verify the changes work correctly

These changes ensure that the Gabriel AI assistant will function properly in the production environment, providing the full capabilities of the OpenAI Assistant API rather than using fallback mode.
